Chanson Studio is a Decentralised NFT online platform to promote, capture and propagate music inspirations. Chason is powered by Algorand blockchain and its super-fast transaction speed and secure smart contract technologies. 
Chanson has an innovative feature whereby music creators can mint NFTs for any musical works they created whether it is a full solo piece or just an unfinished melody. Other creators can then build on these musical components to create more music while the original creators get paid through their NFT copyright.
Chason also provides decentralized finance features such as NFT presale, and NFT leasing on top of the music copyright NFTs.
Chason aims to reward music creators fairly and encourage more creation and innovations in the music industry through our platform.
